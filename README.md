# Palindrome Checker

This is a simple Java program that checks whether a given number or string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, number, or sequence of characters that reads the same forwards and backwards.

## How It Works

- The program prompts the user to enter a number or string.
- It reverses the input and checks whether the original input matches the reversed input.
- If the input is the same forwards and backwards, it is identified as a palindrome.
- Otherwise, it is not a palindrome.

## Features

- **Input Handling**: The program accepts any input string, whether it's a number, word, or phrase.
- **Palindrome Check**: The input is reversed using a `for` loop, and then the original and reversed strings are compared using the `equals()` method.

## How to Run

### 1. Compile the Code:
First, make sure you have Java installed. You can compile the code using the following command:

```bash
javac Palindrome.java
